# Just-Another-Survival-Game

This is a 2016 project made while on my 2nd Highschool year (3 years total), 
the aim of this project was to make a game in Java to compete on the anual game fair hosted at the school.

The project concept is to be a survival game where the player has to survive waves of zombies while progressing on the (not-yet implemented)
story in order to beat the game.

This version is NOT the final version of the project, it is full of bugs, lacks scenes for the player to walk on and has not a wide variety
of sprites.
